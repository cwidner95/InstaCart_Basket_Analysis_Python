# InstaCart_Basket_Analysis_Python
Using Python to wrangle and analyze several datasets for InstaCart. A report was then created to communicate my analysis process and answer key business questions.

## Objective
Instacart is an online grocery stor that operates through an app. Although Instacart already has very good sales, they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.

## Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want touse simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

## Data
The following datasets were used for analysis:
- Customers
- Orders
- Orders_products_prior
- Products
- Departments

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: For data analysis
- Numpy: For mathematical equations
- Seaborn: For data visualizations
- Matplotlib: For data visualizations
- SciPy: For mathematical equations

## Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- **01 Project Management:** Project brief
- **02 Data:** Separated into two subfolders (Original and Prepared Data), these contain the original data frames and the cleaned and prepared data frames. (Note: Files not uploaded to GitHub due to size)  
- **03 Scripts:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for analysis.
- **04 Analysis:** The Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for explaining findings.
- **05 Sent to Client:** An Excel file that contains the final report and findings.

## Resources
Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
